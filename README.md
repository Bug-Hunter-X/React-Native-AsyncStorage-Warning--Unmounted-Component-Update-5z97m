This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in React Native applications involving AsyncStorage and component unmounting. The bug occurs when asynchronous operations using AsyncStorage are initiated within a component's lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`), and the component unmounts before these operations complete. This leads to a warning about updating an unmounted component.  The solution involves properly canceling or handling these asynchronous tasks within `componentWillUnmount` to prevent memory leaks and unexpected behavior.  The provided examples show the bug and its solution.
