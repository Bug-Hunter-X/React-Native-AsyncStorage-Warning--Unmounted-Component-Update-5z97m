In React Native, a seemingly innocuous error can arise when using AsyncStorage, especially within a component's lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` or `componentWillUnmount`. The problem occurs if you attempt to access AsyncStorage asynchronously without proper error handling and the component unmounts before the asynchronous operation completes. This can manifest as a warning message like: "Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a potential memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in `componentWillUnmount`.<\/p>\n  <\/pre>\n\nThis error is tricky because it's not immediately obvious what is causing the issue, particularly if other parts of the AsyncStorage usage are working fine.  The core of the issue is a race condition.  The component unmounts before AsyncStorage's asynchronous callback executes.
